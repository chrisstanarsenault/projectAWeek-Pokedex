# React Pokedex - V1

This is project 1, created following along with [Florin Pop]("https://github.com/florinpop17")'s weekly project challenge.

I had to create a Pokedex with the information from the [Pokedex API]("https://pokeapi.co/"), with the requirements that users can search a pokemon by name, and that the user can see pokemon type, sprite, abilities, and description.

I created a grid of cards for all 150 original pokemon. A user can either click on a card which then brings up a Pokedex with more information about that Pokemon, or they can type a pokemon's name or card number into the input field to also bring it up.

I have ideas for a second version of this app which will clean up some of the features, which i will eventual redo.
